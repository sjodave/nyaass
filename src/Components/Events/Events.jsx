          <b>Bhaji Mandai -</b>
          When the students were able to sell the groceries, make profit, do
          transactions as well as bargaining, they learnt various skills such as
          money management, social awareness, communication, etc. This event of
          “Bhaji Mandai”, which literally translates into vegetable market and
          metaphorically into a mess, was conducted for the students to learn
          and gain some practical exposure. Sometimes, even mess is a great
          teacher.

          <b> Visit to Gandhi Bhavan -</b> Mahatma Gandhi is known by every
          child in our society, but who all can actually understand his values,
          teachings and principles. Our students were able to learn all this
          when we visited Gandhi Bhavan in Kothrud, Pune as a part of the annual
          function. Students learnt it all through various animated movies there
          and then expressed their happiness through various dance performances.

          to mother earth was learnt by preparing the eco-friendly idol of Lord
          Ganesha and was promoted by all the students on a stall in Warje area.
