            When the students were able to sell the groceries, make profit, do
            transactions as well as bargaining, they learnt various skills such
            as money management, social awareness, communication, etc. This
            event of “Bhaji Mandai”, which literally translates into vegetable
            market and metaphorically into a mess, was conducted for the
            students to learn and gain some practical exposure. Sometimes, even
            mess is a great teacher.
