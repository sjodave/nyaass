              We treat education like industrial manufacturing when, in reality,
              it's closer to organic farming. In farming, crops have different
              needs at different times in order to produce the greatest yield.

            <p>
              A holistic methodology seeks to help children develop all their
              skills and to build their strengths. As such, this educational
              approach is inclined towards play-based learning, children’s
              creativity, and their imagination. The result is a child who
              develops better communication and social skills, and better
              confidence. They feel good about learning and challenging
              themselves with certain subjects because these things offer
              positive associations. Intrinsic motivation, in turn, propels them
              to be curious, inquisitive, and eventually be innovative adults in
              the workplace.

            <p>
              In a traditional teacher-centered model, the instructor is the
              “imparter of knowledge” while students listen, and are corrected
              and evaluated on their performance. In a student-centered model,
              the playing field becomes leveled; the focus is on both the
              teachers and students. It opens the door to a multitude of
              possibilities for educational curricula.

            <p>
              The core role of a teacher is to facilitate learning. The concept
              of agility in teaching and learning nicely captures the idea that
              education has to be active, nimble and responsive. It conveys a
              sense of vitality rather than passivity.

            <p>
              Activity-based learning encourages students to actively
              participate in their own learning experience through practical
              activities such as problem-solving and independent investigation.
              We offer interactive learning forums based around:
              <br /> Exploration – gathering knowledge and acquiring skills
              through active investigation.
              <br />
              Experimentation – gathering knowledge through experience.
              <br /> Expression – encouraging kids to express their views
              through discussion.

            <p>
              Standardized testing is designed to get every student to arrive at
              the same correct answer to a question, which encourages a sea of
              sameness. On the other hand, evaluation makes them realise what it
              is now and what upgradation needs to be done. The way standardized
              tests are used today, they do more to tell us what's wrong with
              students by pointing out their inadequacies. evaluations do more
              to tell us what's strong with students by helping them discover
              and develop their own unique talents.
