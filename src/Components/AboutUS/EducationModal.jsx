            We treat education like industrial manufacturing when, in reality,
            it's closer to organic farming. In farming, crops have different
            needs at different times in order to produce the greatest yield.
            Health: Promoting the development and well-being of the whole
            student, intellectually, physically, spiritually, and socially.
            Ecology: Recognizing the vital interdependence of all of these
            aspects of development, within each student and the community as a
            whole Fairness: Cultivating the individual talents and potential of
            all students, whatever their circumstances and respects the roles
            and responsibilities of those who work with them. Creating optimum
            conditions for students' development, based on compassion,
            experience, and practical wisdom.

            A holistic methodology seeks to help children develop all their
            skills and to build their strengths. As such, this educational
            approach is inclined towards play-based learning, children’s
            creativity, and their imagination. The result is a child who
            develops better communication and social skills, and better
            confidence. They feel good about learning and challenging themselves
            with certain subjects because these things offer positive
            associations. Intrinsic motivation, in turn, propels them to be
            curious, inquisitive, and eventually be innovative adults in the
            workplace.

            In a traditional teacher-centered model, the instructor is the
            “imparter of knowledge” while students listen, and are corrected and
            evaluated on their performance. In a student-centered model, the
            playing field becomes leveled; the focus is on both the teachers and
            students. It opens the door to a multitude of possibilities for
            educational curricula.

            The core role of a teacher is to facilitate learning. The concept of
            agility in teaching and learning nicely captures the idea that
            education has to be active, nimble and responsive. It conveys a
            sense of vitality rather than passivity.

            Activity-based learning encourages students to actively participate
            in their own learning experience through practical activities such
            as problem-solving and independent investigation. We offer
            interactive learning forums based around:
            <br /> Exploration – gathering knowledge and acquiring skills
            through active investigation.
            <br />
            Experimentation – gathering knowledge through experience.
            <br /> Expression – encouraging kids to express their views through
            discussion.

            Standardized testing is designed to get every student to arrive at
            the same correct answer to a question, which encourages a sea of
            sameness. On the other hand, evaluation makes them realise what it
            is now and what upgradation needs to be done. The way standardized
            tests are used today, they do more to tell us what's wrong with
            students by pointing out their inadequacies. evaluations do more to
            tell us what's strong with students by helping them discover and
            develop their own unique talents.
