          “Libraries store the energy that fuels the imagination. They open up
          windows to the world and help us explore and achieve and help us
          improve the quality of life.” -Sidney Sheldon Everything begins with
          an idea. Ideas can be life-changing. Sometimes all you need to open
          the door is just one more good idea. And we did the same thing. We
          started the initiative of "Pustak Pedhi" back in 2019-2020 with a
          small spark of imagination, with a small idea. We understood that for
          any person to rise and shine, and become a better version of
          themselves, they need to go through the tough process of reinventing
          themselves. And what better way to empower someone and help them
          become a better version of themselves than books.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus began the idea of "Pustak Pedhi" which loosely translates to
          “Book Bank”. Yes, you read that right, a book bank, where you give us
          your time in exchange for an abundance of knowledge and self-growth.
          The campaign‟s mission is to motivate children to read by giving them
          access to age-appropriate books and reading resources, and working
          with them to make reading a fun and beneficial part of their daily
          lives. Books are a great platform to help you with a variety of
          things. In this world of the internet, children are getting lost
          somewhere. We help them find themselves and rekindle the essence of
          reading. The initiative of "Pustak Pedhi" is not just meant for the
          child reading it, but it also inculcates a habit of reading amongst
          their siblings, their parents, their friends, and all their social
          group.

          This instills reading as a habit in the entire community in general.
          And a well-read community is an empowered community. And as a cherry
          on top, the libraries that we set up are not just „for the children,
          but they will also be „by the children. This means that the libraries
          being set up will be and be run by one of the residents of the Vasti.
          The child will take care of their library and we will take care of
          whatever they need. These children also keep an eye on inventory, help
          other children find suitable books according to their preferences and
          also help us understand the needs of children better, providing us
          with the scope to improve. And if thoughts such as when, where, and
          who conducts these sessions are still lingering in your mind, then let
          me clear them for you. Currently, we are working on 3 Vasahats in
          Karvenagar. We are working in three places namely San Vasti, Kamana
          Vasahat, and Gosavi Vasti. And we plan to keep on adding more and more
          books and more and more areas to our collection. We have a collection
          of 900+ books with us. Thus, to summarize, "Pustak Pedhi" is an
          initiative for us to inculcate the habit of reading in children, in
          turn, the community as a whole and helping them with all they need for
          it. We feel if we empower the young minds of the community today: we
          help build a strong, wellread, and developed society tomorrow.
          Because, "Padhega India, Tabhi Toh Badhega India."
